    "## MYSQL SUB-QUERIES\n",
    "\n",
    "    In SQL a Subquery can be simply defined as a query within another query.\n",
    "    In other words we can say that a Subquery is a query that is embedded in WHERE clause of another SQL query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can place the Subquery in a number of SQL clauses: WHERE clause, HAVING clause, FROM clause\n",
    "\n",
    "    Subqueries can be used with SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE statements along with expression operator. It could be equality operator or comparison operator such as =, >, =, <= and Like operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A subquery is a query within another query. The outer query is called as main query and inner query is called as subquereries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The subquery generally executes first when the subquery doesn’t have any co-relation with the main query, when there is a co-relation the parser takes the decision on the fly on which query to execute on precedence and uses the output of the subquery accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Subquery must be enclosed in parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "    Subqueries are on the right side of the comparison operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ORDER BY command cannot be used in a Subquery. GROUPBY command can be used to perform same function as ORDER BY command.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use single-row operators with singlerow Subqueries. Use multiple-row operators with multiple-row Subqueries.\n",

    "### Stored Procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "*A stored procedure in MySQL is a **set of SQL statements that can be stored in the database and executed later**.*\n",
    "\n",
    "    Definition: A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that are stored on the database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encapsulation: It encapsulates a series of SQL statements and procedural logic, providing a way to execute multiple commands as a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Execution: Stored procedures are executed on the server, which reduces the amount of data transferred between the client and the server, improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters: Stored procedures can take input parameters and return output parameters, making them flexible for various scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reuse: Once created, stored procedures can be reused by multiple applications or parts of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Security: Stored procedures can help enhance security by allowing controlled access to data. Users can execute a stored procedure without having direct access to the underlying tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Modularity: They promote modularity in database development by allowing developers to break down complex tasks into manageable, reusable units.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Transaction Control: Stored procedures can include transaction control statements (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK), allowing for better control over database transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Performance: The precompiled nature of stored procedures can lead to improved performance compared to executing individual SQL statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Maintenance: Centralized management of logic within stored procedures simplifies maintenance and updates, as changes can be made in one place.\n",

    "    \n",
