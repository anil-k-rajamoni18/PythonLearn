    "- Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used in creating a \"bridge\" between object-oriented programs and, in most cases, relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object-Oriented-Programming --> ORM ---> Relational Database\n",
    "- ORM as the **layer that connects object oriented programming (OOP) to relational databases**. \n",

    "## What is an ORM Tool?\n",

    "- An ORM tool is software designed to help OOP developers interact with relational databases. So instead of creating your own ORM software from scratch, you can make use of these tools.\n",

    "Here's an example of SQL code that retrieves information about a particular user from a database:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT id, name, email, country, phone_number FROM users WHERE id = 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "The code above returns information about a user — name, email, country, and phone_number — from a table called users. Using the WHERE clause, we specified that the information should be from a user with an id of 20. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an ORM tool can do the same query as above with simpler methods. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "users.GetById(20)\n",
    "```\n",
    "So the code above does the same as the SQL query.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Every SQLAlchemy application that connects to a database needs to use an Engine\n",

    "\n",

In this case, we’re using the name pysqlite, which in modern Python use is the sqlite3 standard library interface for SQLite. If omitted, SQLAlchemy will use a default DBAPI for the particular database selected.\n",
    "\n",
