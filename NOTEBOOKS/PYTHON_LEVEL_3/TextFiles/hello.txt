The company’s focus on wheeled AMRs (autonomous mobile robots) dates back to its 2012 purchase of Kiva Systems, whose platforms have formed the foundation for the whole of Amazon Robotics. 

A system needs to demonstrate an increase in productivity in order for Amazon to integrate it into its growing robotics ecosystem. 
It’s less innovation for innovation’s sake, and more scoping out any possible advantage that will get goods to customers in less time. Including drones.


The biggest talking point around the form factor is the fact that humans build workspaces for other humans. 
That includes shelving heights, terrain, aisle width and the staircase, the bane of the ARM’s existence. 
From this standpoint a humanoid robot suddenly makes a lot more sense. The reality of things is that most companies operate in brownfield sites. 
That is to say their warehouses and factories generally aren’t built with specific automation solutions in mind. Humanoid robots slot nicely into a brownfield site.
