    "    \n",
    "    - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability\n",
    "    - It is an open source, interpreted, objected-oriented programming language. \n",
    "    - It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991\n",
    "  > **The name of Python programming language was derived from a British sketch comedy series, Month Python's Flying Circus**\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - Python is widely used in various domains such as \n",
    "         - web development, \n",
    "         - data analysis, \n",
    "         - artificial intelligence, \n",
    "         - scientific computing, and automation due to its versatility and the vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks available.\n",
    "     \n",
    "#### Key Features of Python\n",
    "1. **Readability and Simplicity:**\n",
    "      - Python’s syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, which makes it a great choice for beginners and for rapid development.\n",
    "2. **Interpreted Language:**\n",
    "    - Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.\n",
    "3. **Dynamically Typed:**\n",
    "    - We don't need to declare the type of a variable when we create one.\n",
    "    - Python determines the type at runtime, which makes writing code faster and more flexible.\n",
    "4. **Versatile:**\n",
    "    - Python can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple scripting to complex machine learning algorithms. \n",
    "5. **Extensive Standard:**\n",
    "    - Python comes with a rich standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as file I/O, system calls, and even web browsing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. **Community Support:**\n",
    "    - Python has a large and active community. \n",
    "    - This means we can find a lot of resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries to help you with your projects."

    "### Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python variables are simply containers for storing data values\n",
    "- In Python, a variable is a symbolic name that refers to or represents a value stored in memory. \n",
    "- A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. \n",
    "- It allows you to store data that you can use and manipulate throughout your program. \n",
    "- Variables can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"https://www.codesdope.com/pa-images-bucket/courses/python/v3.jpg\"  width=\"500\" height=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variableName = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### KeyPoints\n",
    "- You assign a value to a variable using the equals sign (=). The variable name is on the left, and the value is on the right.\n",
    "- Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning you don’t need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. The type is inferred from the value you assign to it\n",
    "- Python determines the **variable’s type at runtime based on the value** assigned\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming Conventions Rules\n",
    "    - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
    "    - A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
    "    - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
    "    - Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)\n",
    "    - A variable cannot have same name as Reserved word or KEYWORD (e.g., class, for, if)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### JAVA\n",
    "- Java is Strongly typed language \n",
    "- Java is static language \n",
    "- we have to manually declare datatypes for variables.\n",
    "- for every DATATYPES , there will be FIXED RANGE & SIZE\n",
    "```java\n",
    "    datatypes variableName = value;\n",
    "\n",
    "    int age = 10;\n",
    "    String name = \"Kumar\";\n",
    "```\n",

    "- Python is Dynamic\n",
